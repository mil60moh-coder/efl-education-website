    <h1>Year 6 – English as a Foreign Language</h1>

    <p>
      Year 6 represents a key transition stage in primary education. Learners consolidate
      core language structures while developing greater confidence, accuracy, and
      independence in communication.
    </p>

    <h2>Pedagogical focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Meaningful use of language in familiar contexts</li>
      <li>Balanced development of listening, speaking, reading, and writing</li>
      <li>Gradual reinforcement of grammar through use, not memorisation</li>
      <li>Encouragement of learner autonomy and reflection</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Programme structure</h2>
    <p>
      The Year 6 programme is organised into thematic units. Each unit integrates vocabulary,
      grammar, skills, and values in a coherent and progressive manner.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <p>
  <strong>Unit 1 – Entertaining myself</strong><br>
  <a href="year6/unit1/lesson1.html">Lesson 1: Let’s have fun</a>
</p>

      <li>Unit 2 – People, places, and descriptions</li>
      <li>Unit 3 – Food, health, and habits</li>
      <li>Unit 4 – Leisure, sports, and interests</li>
      <li>Unit 5 – Nature, environment, and responsibility</li>
      <li>Unit 6 – Past experiences and simple narratives</li>
      <li>Unit 7 – Future plans and personal aspirations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assessment approach</h2>
    <p>
      Assessment in Year 6 is viewed as a continuous process. Activities, practice tasks,
      and tests are designed to support learning rather than interrupt it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-check opportunities are provided to help learners monitor their own progress and
      develop responsibility for learning.
    </p>

    <h2>How to use this section</h2>
    <p>
      Teachers and learners may follow the units sequentially or focus on specific areas
      according to needs. Practice, tests, and self-check materials are aligned with the
      objectives of each unit.
